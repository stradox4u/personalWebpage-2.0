# sevenSegmentClock
I wrote this, to test my JavaScript knowledge, and to actually build something myself.
Currently doing a JavaScript course on Udemy, and I'm tired of just coding along, and not sure if I'm learning anything.
So this here was just practice, to see how much I have learnt.
I hope to update it when I am more mature, to actually live update itself and run like a normal clock.
